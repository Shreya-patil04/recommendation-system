**INTRAINZ INNOVATION PRIVATE LTD - Internship**  

**NAME:** Shreya Chandrakant Patil
**DOMAIN NAME:** Data Science  
**BATCH DURATION:** 10th December 2024 to 10th February 2025 
**MENTOR NAME:** Mr. Karthik Reddy  

### **Description of Tasks Performed**  
During my internship at **INTRAINZ INNOVATION PRIVATE LTD**, I worked on key concepts of **Python programming, machine learning, and data science**. My tasks included implementing **advanced Python techniques** such as **decorators, generators, and object-oriented programming**, as well as working with **SQL databases, data visualization, and machine learning models**.  

### **Minor Project: Report on "Decorators and Generators in Python"**  
Prepared a comprehensive report on **Decorators and Generators in Python**, detailing their functionality, real-world applications, and best practices. The report includes **code examples and use cases** to demonstrate their importance in writing **efficient, reusable, and scalable Python programs**.  

### **Major Project: Online Retail Recommendation System**  
Developed an **AI-powered recommendation system** that enhances **user personalization in e-commerce** by analyzing shopping behavior. The system applies **collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms** to generate **personalized product recommendations**.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Core Programming, OOP, Decorators, Generators)  
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
- **SQL** (Data Storage and Retrieval)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Recommendation Algorithms** (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)  

### **Project Summaries**  

#### **1. Decorators and Generators in Python**  
- **Description:** Explores how **decorators modify function behavior dynamically** and how **generators improve memory efficiency** by yielding values on demand.  
- **Summary:** Includes **theoretical explanations, practical applications, and Python code implementations**.  

#### **2. Online Retail Recommendation System**  
- **Description:** A **machine learning-based system** that recommends products to users based on their **browsing and purchase history**.  
- **Summary:** Implements **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and recommendation algorithms**, improving **user experience through AI-driven insights**.
